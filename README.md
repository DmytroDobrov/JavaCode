This program allows the user to write a 4-word sentence with  first name, last name, age and any last word.
The variables "name", "surname", "age" and "lastword" are private, i.e. they are accessed through a method, in this case with the
using set. Thus, we have to give a value to the variables ourselves.
The command "this" creates a duplicate of the variable, but without initial data in it, and also equals the method parameter.
The Scanner class with the System.in parameter allows the user to manually enter data.
"g." is an instance of the Sentence class, in whose parameters we call the methods of the Scanner class.
